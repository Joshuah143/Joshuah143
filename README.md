Hi! Iâ€™m Joshua,

I am a UBC Engineering Physics student. Always looking for opportunities to contribute and have an impact!

I am always happy to chat about my work. Feel free to [send me an email (joshua@himmens.com)](mailto:joshua@himmens.com), [message me on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joshua-himmens-a08010245/), or [check out my website (himmens.com)](https://himmens.com).

Due to licensing constraints, I am unable to share direct work products from TRIUMF, UBC Orbit, and AltaML. Instead, you can read about them [on my website](himmens.com).
